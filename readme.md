# Sublime Text 3 Settings

These are my working settings and packages for Sublime Text 3. This repo allows me to keep consistent settings and packages across  development machines anywhere I go.

## Usage

The best way to handle this is to load these files before you install Sublime Text however you can do this any way you'd like. Just get this repo into `~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 3/` and you will be finished.

```
cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 3/
git clone git@github.com:jimmyhillis/sublime-settings.git .
```

Supports Sublime Text 2 and Sublime Text 3 however it has been tweaked for Sublime Text 3 and may not work for 2 for much longer.
